<p><b>[Abstract]</b>  Shooting game is very prevalent in many game players。Those game players repeat firing bullets shooting the enemy, avoiding attacks until the end of this process. Many people follow the same pattern in this play find that it is more and more boring. Contain study in fun, based on this consideration, this game is emerged as the call of demand. Many Chinese students chat with Chinese words easily and quickly, but rather jerky when typing English words. Typing English words is not equal to play twenty-six English characters. The word has its vocabulary root, and many tedious typing-softwares just let the learners to practise single characters again and again. To solve the problems, the shooting game WordWar was designed. The game uses random selection of different English words, making a word never appear more than once when players playing. The Game players are no longer simply press the attack can hit shots. In the game, players should input complete a correct word to destroy a corresponding word. At the same time, the game will also display the Chinese interpretation of the word, if an unfamiliar word appears, you can see the Chinese explanation immediately, which helps you learning English. In the game, we have three kinds of modes. For the people who are not familiar with typing English words, the Practice Mode is a good choice. If someone is good at English typing, they can choose the Challenge Mode instead, which providing much faster words’ refresh rate and speed. The third one is the Online Mode, in which the players can play with friends even when they are far from each others. C/S construction is used with the Online Mode, and the whole game is achieved with C++. The rendering part requires the HGE’s dynamic linking library for GPU acceleration. The game program supports Windows series operating system.</p>
